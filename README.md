# Max_Welding_Tool
Script for welding intersecting objects in *3ds Max*.

To run this script in *3ds Max* find *Scripting - Run Script...* then find the location where you saved the script.

For the plugin to work you first have to have at least 2 intersecting objects in the scene. 

Selecting 2 or more intersecting objects, then clicking on *Generate Intersecting Weld*, the *Weld* will be created.

The *Weld* doesn't merge objects. It just creates a new *Spline* around the intersecting egdes.

Plugin gives you some simple settings for editing the shape of the *Spline*.

Here are two examples where the plugin created a (red) *Spline* which represents a *Weld*.
