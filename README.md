# Max_Welding_Tool
Script for welding intersecting objects in 3ds Max.

In 3ds Max find Scripting - Run Script... then find the location where you saved the script.

For the plugin to work you first have to have at least 2 intersecting objects in the scene. 

Selecting 2 or more intersecting objects, then clicking on Generate Intersecting Weld, the weld will be created.

The weld doesn't merge objects. It just creates a new spline around the intersecting egdes.

Plugin gives you some simple settings for editing the shape of spline.
